Game description :

Game is a maze of rooms filled with dangerous objects. Light is visible only in the entrance, and no other light is seen anywhere in the caverns.

Player must navigate through the rooms with other senses. The player wins by moving to the fountain room, enabling the Fountain of Objects, and moving back
to the cavern entrance. If the player is in the entrance and the fountain is on, the player wins


There are 3 size of boards you can choose: 4 x 4 (default), 6 x 6, 8 x 8. 

You can also choose different challenges:

Pits Challege -- Look out for pits. You will feel a breeze if a pit is in an adjacent room,
                 If you enter a room with a pit, you will die.
                 
Amaroks Challenge -- Amaroks roam the caverns. Encountering one is certain death,
                      but you can smell their rotten stench in nearby rooms.

Full Game Challenge--Contains both Pits and Amaroks!


You can add bonus maelstrom challenge to each of above:
maelstroms challenge -- Maelstroms are violent forces of sentient wind.
                      Entering a room with one could transport you to 1 room up and 2 room right.
                      Maelstrom will move itself 1 room bottom and 2 room left in the caverns.
                      If the player will sweep away to another dangerous location, such as a pit,
                      that room’s effects will happen upon landing in that room.
                      If Maelstrom effect will move the player or maelstrom beyond the map’s edge, they stay on the map.
